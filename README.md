# SETENFORCE 1 !

Platform9 products and services can run in secure environments, as long as security
portals are opened up for certain core functionality.  

This repository is a utility for bootstrapping and documenting any SELinux related portals.  

You can apply one, or many of these at any time before your platform9 installation.

In addition to containing the actual SELinux policy files for specific features which
need to be enabled, this repostiroy also has an AVCs file, where we maintain example
AVCs that might occur while you install CSI, CNI, or other security sensitive services.

# Using this repo

- `git clone https://github.com/platform9/selinuxmodules`
- (optional) Edit or remove any policies in these  shell scripts.  
- `./apply.sh`

# Developing and adding to this repo

To monitor these AVCs to build new policy's, just run:

- `tail -f /var/log/audit.log` and look for avc denials or failures.

To fix such failures and create new policies, just cat them into audit2allow, like so:

- `audit2allow -a -M pf9user <  /var/log/audit.log`

This will result in a new pf9user.pp policy file which you can apply, or pull request to this 
repository.

# Selinux policies for platform9

This repository contains a list of policies which can be applied to
enable Enforcing status for the PMK and PMO products.  Use it in concert
with your system administrator (or platform9's customer success team).
